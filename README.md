# ðŸ›’ Demand Forecasting for a Retail Store  

Predicting product demand using Machine Learning to optimize inventory management and reduce stock-outs.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project aims to develop a demand forecasting model for a retail store using historical sales data. By applying machine learning techniques, the model provides accurate predictions of product demand, helping in efficient inventory management and better decision-making.  

### âœ… **Key Objectives:**  
- Predict the number of units sold using historical data.  
- Improve forecasting accuracy using advanced machine learning algorithms.  
- Optimize inventory levels and reduce operational costs.

## ðŸš€ Approach  

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
    - Handled missing values.  
    - Removed outliers using the 99th percentile threshold.  
    - Created additional time-based features (`day`, `month`, `year`).  
    - Applied one-hot encoding to categorical data.  

2. **Feature Engineering:**  
    - Generated price-related features like `price_ratio` (`total_price / base_price`).  
    - Created lag features for better demand prediction.  
    - Incorporated cyclic encoding for temporal features.  

3. **Model Building:**  
    - Implemented a baseline **Random Forest Regressor** achieving an initial RÂ² score of **0.77**.  
    - Improved the accuracy using hyperparameter tuning, resulting in a final RÂ² score of **0.83**.  

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
    - Applied **Grid Search** with cross-validation to optimize model parameters.  
    - **Best Parameters:**  
      - `min_samples_split`: **3**  
      - `n_estimators`: **20**  

5. **Evaluation:**  
    - Evaluated using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and **RÂ² Score**.  
    - **Final Results:**  
      - **RÂ² Score:** 0.83  
      - **RMSE:** 17.77
